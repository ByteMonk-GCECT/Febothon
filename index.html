        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          “Everybody has a creative potential and from the moment you can
          express this creative potential, you can start changing the world” –
          Paulo Coelho <br>
          So, here the GCECT – Tech Club in collaboration with MLSA
          and GDSC-GCECT presents you with the opportunity to enhance your
          skills. The Feb-O-Thon ’22 is alive, let’s not miss it! It is where
          your crazy ideas become reality. It is an event gathering various
          programmers, designers and businessmen and other domain experts
          together to intensively collaborate on a project. The word hackathon
          is a portmanteau of the word hacker, which means clever programmer,
          and marathon, an event marked by endurance. It is an activity that
          brings something useful or cool to the world. This year we the
          ByteMonk - GCECT Tech Club is hosting this Collaborative global event,
          Hackathon ’22 with the name of FEB-O-THON ’22. The main draw will be
          the online sessions by Industrial Experts on various topics related to
          modern technologies. The event will continue for seven days. It will
          be succeeded by an Open Source event which will be online for a month.
